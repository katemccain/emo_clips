## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### import data set
# I am bad at typing filepaths in and will always use the 'import dataset' button on the top right, but you could use the code below

read.csv(insert filepath here)

## Get rid of the first two columns, they have PHI

better_data <- subset(prescreen_data, select = -c(first_name, last_name))

## Save as a .csv

write.csv(better_data, "anonymous_prescreen_results")
